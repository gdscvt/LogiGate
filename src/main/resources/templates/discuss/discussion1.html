		<h2>Question about problem statement</h2>

		<p class="op-post">Hello, I did not understand exactly what the problem wanted us to do. Does it want us to find the answer for each person or for all of them combined?</p>

		<div class="user-posts">
			<p>The problem is asking for the amount of chocolate recieved for each individual person</p>
			<p>The problem wants you to find the amount of choclate for Jack, Charlotte, and Cody seperately</p>
			<p>Thanks for the clarification!</p>
